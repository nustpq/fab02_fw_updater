  instead of external RAM (ROM code v1.1 and later).
- Modified command line parser to require either -d or -b option with -a and -m
  options to allow different help messages to be displayed depending on the
  device familly.
- Extended 'secure' port with device specific monitor commands for SAMA5D2 and
  SAM9X60.

  SAM-BA monitor



## Version 3.2.3

### Bugfixes

- Fixed 'extram' applet so the 'preset' parameter can be set from the command
  line.
- Added missing JLinkARM.dll file in win32 archive.

### API Changes

- No changes were made to the QML API



## Version 3.2.2

### Bugfixes

- Fixed applets not working on board designs without external MAIN crystal.
- Fixed J-LINK selection by serial number.
- Fixed J-LINK connections on SAM9XX5.
- Fixed *sleep() issue on SAMA5D31 where applets tried using the non-existing
  TC1.
- Added new 'internalrc' applet on SAMA5D2 to force the use of the 12MHz
  internal RC instead of the external MAIN crystal (Needed before programming
  fuses on SAMA5D27 SOM).
- Added new 'enablebootpartition' command to 'sdmmc' applet to enable/disable
  eMMC boot partitions.

### Enhancements

- All applets rebuilt using softpack 2.13 + few additional patches. This brings
  support for more SPI/QSPI NOR memories.
- Allow to change the speed of J-Link connections.
- Added new 'reset' applet.
- Added new 'enablebootpartition' command to 'sdmmc' applet.
- Added new 'tag' and 'untag' commands to 'nandflash' applet to set/clear bad
  block marks.

### API Changes

- SAM-BA now requires J-LINK SDK V6* to build.
- Extracted the source code for X-Modem support from the serial connection
  plugin to a dedicated shared library.
- Reworked the interface and methods of the Connection class to better abstract
  the sequence of operations executed by the Connection::appletExecute() method.



## Version 3.2.1

### Bugfixes

- Fixed NAND header value for SAM9xx5EK.
- Fixed parsing of numeric arguments to writecfg commands to BootConfig applet.
- Fixed SAMA5D2 fuse boot configuration example to disable BSCR/BUREG

### Enhancements

- All applets rebuilt using softpack 2.10.  This brings support for non-ONFI
  NAND memories and more SPI/QSPI NOR memories using SFDP.
- Applet trace level can be set from command-line (-t, --trace) or QML
  (Script.traceLevel).
- New Fuse example for SAMA5D2

### API Changes

- Applet trace level is now in the Script singleton object.
- Internal shared library sambacommand was removed



## Version 3.2.0

### Bugfixes

- Fixed bug when loading applets on Windows when SAM-BA path contains spaces
- Fixed bug with USB on Windows 10

### Enhancements

- Provide applets for initializing external RAM on all devices.
- All applets rebuilded using latest code from softpack.
- Build with Qt 5.9.0
- Implemented XMODEM support (allows programming using SAM-BA Monitor protocol
  over UART)
- Added support for SD/MMC and e.MMC for SAM9xx5, SAMA5D3 and SAMA5D4
- Board-specific configurations are now in separate QML files, one per board.
- Serial peripheral and pin used for applet traces is now configurable via the
  board configuration and as arguments to the device/board command line
  parameter.
- SAMV71 device family support was completely reworked. It now uses 3.x applets
  from the software package like the other devices.
- J-Link driver now supports SAMV71 device family (E70/S70/V70/V71)
- Added support for new boards sama5d27-som1-ek and sama5d2-ptc-ek.

### API Changes

- SAM-BA now requires Qt 5.9 to build
- SAM-BA QML API modules version is now 3.2
- Some common QML code is shared between similar applets for different devices
- Applet configuration parameters in the device object are now split by applet
  (config.serialflash, config.sdmmc, etc.)
- Board selection is not done using a 'board' property on the device anymore.
  Instead, the boards are defined using inheritance: for example, the
  SAMA5D2Xplained QML object inherits from SAMA5D2 QML object.
- Removed AppletLoader object. Connection object can now be used directly when
  working with applets.



## Version 3.1.4

### Enhancements

- Support for SAM9xx5 (NAND Flash and SPI Flash)
- Add command-line support for 'read', 'write' and 'execute' monitor commands
- Add command-line support for 'fullerase' (SAMV7)
- NAND: retrieve and display NAND header value from applet
- Increase default timeouts, this should fix issues on NAND & SDMMC on SAMA5D4 and SAMA5D2

### Bugfixes

- Fix parsing of addresses bigger than 0x7fffffff on the command-line

### API Changes

- No changes were made to the QML API



## Version 3.1.3

### Enhancements

- Support for SAMA5D3 (NAND Flash and SPI Flash)
- Port command-line option is now optional. When not supplied, the connection
  will default to serial/usb.

### API Changes

- No changes were made to the QML API



## Version 3.1.2

### Enhancements

- Support for SAMA5D4 (NAND Flash and SPI Flash)

### API Changes

- No changes were made to the QML API



## Version 3.1.1

### Enhancements

- NAND Flash support for the SAMA5D2
- SD/MMC support for the SAMA5D2
- Enhanced command line support (see doc/cmdline.html for documentation)

### API Changes

Several small changes where made to the QML API, please see the provided examples.
Notable changes:
- SAM-BA QML API modules version is 3.1
- configuration declaration for SAMA5D2 is less verbose. Default for the
  SAMA5D2 device is to be unconfigured, but the "sama5d2-xplained" board
  property can be set to get the same configuration as previous version.
- boot configuration on the SAMA5D2 now uses an applet and a different syntax.
